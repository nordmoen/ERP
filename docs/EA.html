    <h1>ERP: Evolutionary Algorithm</h1>
    <p>
        The evolutionary algorithm that is currently implented is a mu+lambda EA. 
        In this EA, the next generation of individuals is combined with the previous generation of individuals and the worst individuals are deleted so that the population size remains constant.
        This type of evolutionary algorithm is very 'elitist' (it favors generating robots that resemble the best robots so far) and has the downside of prematurely converging. 
        However, this EA is good enough to quickly get a robot to move in a certain direction.

    <p>
        The evolutionary algorithm works by calling a 'selection' (AKA offspring selection) and a 'replacement' (AKA survivor selection) operator. 
        The selection operator selects new individuals that will need to be evaluated; it creates an offspring population. 
        The replacement operator decides how to replace individuals in the parent population with individuals in the offspring population.

        Using the ERP GUI, you can select different selection and replacement operators under the 'settings' -> 'evolutionary algorithm' tab.
