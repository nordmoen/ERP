<h1>Evolutionary Robotics Plugin for V-REP</h1>
<p>
    This plugin for V-REP is an abstraction of the evolutionary robotics plugin that was developed during my PhD on evolving Modular Robots.
    This plugin contains a simple evolutionary algorithm, encodings that can create modular robots, a simple control architecture, and the possibility to evolve fixed morphology robots in V-REP.
    It also contains a small GUI that can be opened using python 3 and the TKinter package.

    For more information about the science behind the plugin, see my <a href="https://en.itu.dk/~/media/en/research/phd-programme/phd-defences/2018/phd-thesis-final-version-frank-veenstra-pdf.pdf?la=en">PhD dissertation</a>.

    ERP was designed for evolving modular robots, robots that are made up of components that isolate part of the functionality of the entire robot.
    However, ERP is not limited to just evolving modular robot. It can also automatically identify some of the joints and sensors used in other robots simulated in V-REP enabling the user to automatically evolve the behavior of a robot.
    A challenge in evolutionary robotics is the difficulty in changing the controller and morphologies of robots at the same time.
    In this plugin, this challenge can be addressed by experimenting with the (1)  <a href="EA.html">evolutionary algorithm</a> , (2) morphologies and encoding strategies, (3) controllers, (4) artificial neurons, (5) environments, and (6) Module types.
